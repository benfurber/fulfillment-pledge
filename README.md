# The Fulfilled Technologist Pledge

Work is a big proportion of our lives. I plan to be proactive seeking out and working towards being able to state the following.

## As a human, like any other

...

## As a person in the technology industry, with a more specific focus:

In a big or small way, I work to support the world I want to see.<br/>
That could mean…

- Helping to make people’s work or personal lives better
- Creating a level playing field for all
- Protecting people’s privacy
- …Or maintaining the status quo
