# The Fulfilled Technologist Pledge

Work is a big proportion of our lives. I plan to be proactive seeking out and working towards being able to state the following.

## As a human, like any other

I am treated as important.

- My work is valued and appreciated by those I work with
- People interact with me with respect
- I understand how I contribute to the bigger picture

I work with people I want to work with.

- People I work with enhance who I am as a professional
- From those around me, I receive as much support as I need
- I can communicate effectively with those I work with

I am able to bring myself to work.

- I bring as much of myself to my work as I want. Whether that’s wanting to share my whole self or keeping myself to myself.
- The amount of time I spending working supports my life as a whole. Whether that’s the ability to maximise time with friends and family or dedicating myself to my career.

## As a person in the technology industry, with a more specific focus:

I am proud of the work I do and I can go home with my head held high.

- I know technology can help solve the stated problem
- I know I’ve crafted the best code or I’m helping get to market fast
- There is a visible and understandable loop between my work, users and the organisation.

In a big or small way, I work to support the world I want to see.<br/>
That could mean…

- Helping to make people’s work or personal lives better
- Creating a level playing field for all
- Protecting people’s privacy
- …Or maintaining the status quo

I am able to develop and grow myself.

- I have the time available to me to learn new skills
- I am in an environment that understands that I work in a field that requires constant growth
- I am able to apply newly learnt concepts and tools in my work
